Dear {{ recipient_name }},

Project {{ project_code }} - "{{ project_title }}" is expiring on
{{ latest_expiration }}.

Read this message carefully to re-familiarize yourself with the
expiration process and timeline for data retrieval and ultimate
removal.

Project Data Removal Timeline:
Expired projects have 90 days after expiration for data retrieval,
after which all project data is subject to removal from NCAR systems.
You therefore must transfer any required data to your home institution
during this 90 day grace period. Your 90 day post-expiry grace period
will end on {{ grace_expiration }}, after which you will NOT have
further access to project data and it will be removed.

User Account Deactivation and User Data Removal Timeline:
User accounts become disabled when they are no longer associated with
any active project, at which point all user-specific data in your
home, work, and scratch file systems will be removed. If your account
is associated with other, active projects your user data will remain
unaffected.

For additional details on data access and retention policies
see https://arc.ucar.edu/docs/glade.
