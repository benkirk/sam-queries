you keep running into this issue: "The API requires session authentication."  when trying to query my end points.  how can I make this easier on you
between sessions so you can reliably query my APIs?

⏺ Great question! There are a few options to make API testing easier for me:

  Option 1: API Key Authentication (Recommended)

  Add support for API key authentication alongside session auth. This would let me use simple curl commands:

  curl -H "X-API-Key: <your-key>" http://127.0.0.1:5050/api/v1/projects/SCSG0001/allocations

  Looking at your codebase, I see you already have ApiCredentials model with bcrypt password hashing. We could extend this to support API keys.



Option 4: Long-lived Session Token

  Give me a session token that I can reuse:

  # You run this once and give me the token
  curl -c cookies.txt -u benkirk:password http://127.0.0.1:5050/auth/login
  # Then I use:
  curl -b cookies.txt http://127.0.0.1:5050/api/v1/...
cd /Users/benkirk/codes/sam-queries && set -a && source .env && set +a && DISABLE_AUTH=1 DEV_AUTO_LOGIN_USER=benkirk FLASK_DEBUG=1 python3
