Lets continue @docs/SYSTEM_DASHBOARD_PLAN.md.  Phase 1 is done but I
would like to refactor a couple items.  You can compare the current
branch to main to see exactly what has been committed.

(1) The new APIs in @src/webapp/api/v1/status.py seem to do manual
serialization. The existing SAM models make use of marshmallow
serialization, see src/webapp/schemas.  Would it make sense for
these new APIs to do the same?

(2) For the mock data (@tests/mock_data/status_mock_data.json) and
dashboards created, these are great so far.  Casper and Derecho each
have multiple login nodes, but they are of the same type.  So I do not
need to distinguish between GPU and CPU login nodes, but I would like
to support several login nodes per system (8 currently on Derecho, 2
on Casper) so would like to show a row of status per login, with any
required database and ORM changes. Any changes to the data format
should be updated in @docs/HPC_DATA_COLLECTORS_GUIDE.md as well.  **It
is OK to change the API without regard to backwards compatibility,
this has not been deployed.**

(3) the file @src/webapp/templates/dashboards/status/dashboard.html
is already quite busy, lets consider splitting where each of Derecho,
Casper, JupyterHub get their own file.

(4) finally, the @docs/SYSTEM_DASHBOARD_PLAN.md mentions several tests
wgicg have not yet been implemented.  Lets implement those.

You may start the development server with ./utils/run-webapp-dbg.sh,
just please kill it when you are done (to free up port 5050 for me).
