Lets implement the @collectors/docs/PBS_COLLECTORS_PLAN.md, initially
developing the collectors and testing them manually.  We can run the
collectors in a simple while loop for the time being, and defer the
"Deployment" and "Monitoring" for later implementation.

Please pay extra attention to the JSON results from "pbsnodes -aj -F
json" and lets use as much information as possible to infer node types
- for both machines but especially Casper.  Note in particular the
fields under "resources_available", especially "cpu_type", "gpu_type"
"Qlist", etc...  We can infer much from this output instead of
hard-coding conf files.

ssh to casper and derecho both work so you can run relevant commands
for testing.

You can start the development web server via "utils/run-webui-dbg.sh"
which will disable auth for testing purposes, allowing testing the API
aspects, and then checking the dashboard on
http://127.0.0.1:5050/status/.
