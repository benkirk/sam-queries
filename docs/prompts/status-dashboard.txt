Lets plan a system status dashboard to go alongside the existing
initial user dashboard at python/webui/dashboards
python/webui/templates/dashboards, refactoring for commonality as
necessary.

The initial system status dashboard should be a similar tabbed
interface with 3 initial tabs: "Derecho", "Casper", and "JupyterHub".
At first just placeholders for the system statuses.  This refactoring
and tabbed placeholders is phase 1.

Casper is very heterogeneous as described here
https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute-systems/casper/#casper-hardware
so the dashboard should be sufficiently flexible.

Derecho is logically a CPU- and GPU- partition as described here
https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute-systems/derecho/#derecho-hardware

Phase 2 and beyond will pursue: - Flask Side Data consumers for each
resource defined in python/webui/dashboards/status, with any new POST APIs required defined at python/webui/api/v1,

Ideally we will be able to show historical usage for the past <= 7
days using lightweight SVG matplotlib or similar.  This implies a
database of system status.  Rather than putting this into the existing
SAM database as additional tables, I would like to consider options
for a server-side sqlite database to hold just these data or another
database named 'system_status' on the same mysql server defined in the
environment variable SAM_DB_SERVER as used elsewhere in the project.
Lets discuss the pros/cons, I prefer the mysql route if it is
straightforward.

- JupyterHub can remain a placeholder
- Mock HPC side data, with the real HPC side producers / agents coming from a different code base later,
- The HPC data collectors for Derecho and Casper will provide
  information such as
  - Login Node availability, user count, system load
  - Compute Node availability, types and health
  - Queues
  - Number of running jobs & users per queue \
  - Number of pending jobs per queue
  - GPU/CPU utilization, (+memory for Casper)
  - File system information
  - Known outages or degraded resources
  - Resource reservations (if any)
