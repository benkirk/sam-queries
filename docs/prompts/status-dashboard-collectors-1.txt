considering the needs of the POST APls in
@python/webui/api/v1/status.py, lets update the
@docs/HPC_DATA_COLLECTORS_GUIDE.md to create a collectors
implementation plan. The problem at the moment is it is incomplete and
assumes slurm.

I want you to create a plan using the PBS-specific commands shown in
@utils/sample_collector_commands.sh.  you may run that script or its
commands, they will create lots of output so be prepared.

I want to fill out the
```pre
collectors
├── casper
├── derecho
└── jupyterhub
```

directory tree, beginning with casper and derecho, with scripts that
can be run as collectors, probably cron triggered but as a daemon is
OK too.  A combination of python, make, and bash is fine.

Given the similarites of the commands lets make the resulting
collectors share as much commonality as reasonable.
